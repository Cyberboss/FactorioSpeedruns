##The Run

###Power I

  As the game is loading, immediately start running down and to the right. When the game loads craft 2 Iron pickaxes, start researching Automation, and press Alt to turn on detailed overlays. Here is the path you should take:

  The two X's are covering two trees you need to cut down along the way. Once you have done so, immediately craft a wooden chest and continue to your destination. This area will be where you'll be spending most of this split. When you arrive place down the items in your inventory like so.
  
  SCREEN 2
  
  Circled in red are the squares you should be mining soon. Add 1 of your logs to both the drill and the furnace and immediately start mining coal. Once you have 5 coal place 2 in the furnace and 3 in the drill. Mine 1 more coal (use the same patch for any leftover progress) and 5 stone. Once you grab the 5th stone, collect the iron from your furnace. You should now have enough to craft another drill, so do so. While it's crafting mine 2 more coal. Place the drill under the wooden box such that it unloads into it, load it with all you coal, and resume mining stone. Once you reach 14 stone, collect the coal from the box and the iron. Craft another drill and furnace and keep mining stone.
