#Power I

  As the game is loading, immediately start running down and to the right. When the game loads craft an iron pickaxe, start researching Automation, and press Alt to turn on detailed overlays. Here is the path you should take:

  The two X's are covering two trees you need to cut down along the way. Once you have done so, immediately craft a wooden chest and continue to your destination. This area will be where you'll be spending most of this split. When you arrive place down the items in your inventory like so.

  Circled in red are the squares you should be mining soon. 
  
  I apologize for the numberyness but the early game is heavily optimized, you'll get the hang of it after some practice
  
  - Add 1 of your logs to both the drill and the furnace
  - Mine 5 coal
  - Place the coal in the furnace and drill (Note: when doing an odd split, always give the greater half to the drill as they burn faster than the furnaces)
  - Mine 1 coal
  - Mine 5 stone
  - Collect the iron from your furnace and craft another drill.
  - Mine 2 more coal
  - Place the drill under the wooden box such that it unloads into it, load it with all you coal
  - Mine stone until you reach 14
  - Collect the coal from the box and the iron
  - Craft another drill and furnace
  - Mine stone until you reach 7
  - Place the new mining set to the right of the first one and fill them with your coal
  - Mine 1 stone
  - Grab the coal from the box and refill your first mining set
  - Mine stone until you reach 14
  - Grab all the iron and craft another mining set
  - Mine stone until you reach 7
  - Grab coal from the box and fill the third set
  - Mine stone until you reach 11
  - Craft a drill
  - Mine stone until you reach 8
  - Deconstruct the wooden chest and place the drill in it's place, facing to the right (You should get this done before the first coal drill burns out otherwise you need to mine a coal)
  - Mine stone until you reach 10
  - Collect the iron and craft a drill
  - Mine stone until you reach 7
  - Place the drill to the right of the previous one facing down
  - Mine stone until you reach 9
  - Collect the iron and craft a drill
  - Mine stone until you reach 7
  - Place the last drill so that it completes the loop

 You should now look like this
